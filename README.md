```make``` to compile, ```make clean``` to clean a compilation

two methods of calling:

```./kek part_file_name``` calls with ```WallyHead_Template.png``` as template, ```WallyImages/Wally_{part_file_name}.png``` as src and stores it in ```results/result.png```

```./wally template src result``` to be fully in control
